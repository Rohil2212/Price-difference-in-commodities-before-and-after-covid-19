Hello! My name is Rohil Bhingarde and in this repository, I have added a Tableau project I worked on during my Fall Semester at Lehigh University. The Tableau project is based on analyzing the Price difference in commodities around the world before and after Covid-19. I have attached a pdf file that contains all the vizualisations and dashboards of my findings. Feel free to have a look at it!
